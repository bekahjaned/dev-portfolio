# Welcome to My Portfolio!

This is something I built to showcase my front-end skills and introduce myself.

## Stack

This website was built is React JS and styled with Styled Components.

## Design

I designed this website myself using Figma and used this [tool](https://toolness.github.io/accessible-color-matrix/?n=white&n=teal&n=black&n=dark%20teal&n=pinkish&n=dark%20pink&v=FBFEF9&v=156E78&v=0A100D&v=0B3B40&v=BE4D79&v=A24267) and the Stark plug-in in Figma to check for accesibility.

Screen sizes for mobile, tablet and desktop were considered in this design. It is responsive from 360px and up.

## Sections

### Header

This is where I introduce myself and summarize what I'm all about.

### About

This section provides my background and qualities that make me a strong front-end developer. It also includes a list of things I am currently learning about.

### Work

This section shows off some of my strongest projects. I created a JSON file for my project information and imported it into ProjectCard component.

### Skills

This section shows off my skills, including coding languages I know as well as design softwares.

All the icons in the Skills section were downloaded from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/).

I used the [react-tooltip package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tooltip) in this section so the user could see what each skill/software was, if they weren't familiar with the icon.

### Contact

This section concludes the website with links to reach me at and lists a few other interests of mine.
